                            Below are a list of courses I have taken during my time at 
                            Carnegie Mellon University. I included a brief review of
                            each course, what I liked and disliked about the course, and
                            any other general comments regarding the course material.
                            I hope this helps you in your course selection process! Courses 
                            that I thought were particularly interesting are marked with ✭,
                            and courses that I think makes CMU worth attending are marked with
                            ❤️.

                                <h3>21-127: Concepts of Mathematics</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Clive Newstead</h4>
                                <p>
                                    CMU's 21-127 was my first introduction to formal mathematics
                                    and proof writing. The course provided me with new perspectives 
                                    on discrete math and reshaped my view of mathematics as a formal
                                    logical system. I found the transition to this formal style 
                                    challenging but rewarding as it deepened my mathematical reasoning 
                                    skills. Clive Newstead was an amazing lecturer. During his office 
                                    hours, he would often go into the history of theorems and proofs,
                                    which I found fascinating. Though this course is required for most
                                    STEM majors at CMU, I would highly recommend non-STEM majors to take
                                    it with Clive since it provides a new perspective on mathematics.

                                <h3>15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Iliano Cervesato, Dilsun Kaynar</h4>
                                <p>
                                    15-122 was my first computer science class at CMU. It teaches you how to
                                    write  provably safe and correct programs in a subset of C called C0. 
                                    The course is very difficult to get an A in as a freshman since a lot of 
                                    the material is new and it is designed to be challenging. Regardless,
                                    I found the course to be rewarding as it taught me how to implement the
                                    data structures and algorithms used in the industry in a bare-bones
                                    language. The programming assignments are actually interesting, and the final project
                                    for the course even requires you to implement a virtual machine in C. Overall,
                                    I think 15-122 is a great introduction to computer science, and has the added
                                    benefit of making you a well-versed in C right off the bat.
                                    <br><br>
                                    P.S. I am currently TAing this course, so I am a bit biased. It's still a great course to take, though!
                                    I think this along with 21-127/21-128/15-151 are CMU's must take courses for anyone, not just STEM majors.
                                    Functions are pointers!

                                <h3>15-150: Principles of Functional Programming ✭ </h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Micheal Erdmann, Karl Crary</h4>
                                <p>
                                    15-150 is CMU's introduction to functional programming course. It is taught in
                                    Standard ML, and teaches you how to write provably correct programs using the functional programming paradigm.
                                    Unlike 15-122, 15-150 is quite easy to get an A if you take it with Erdmann and Crary. The 
                                    programming assignments are challenging, but the exams are very reasonable. The course 
                                    gave me a new perspective on programming, one that I think is very useful for writing correct
                                    code. For example, it's interesting to see that since every SML function is recursive, we can prove 
                                    correctness of our programs using induction. Some of the proofs are very elegant, especially ones
                                    relating to functors and modules. I attended Crary's lectures, and he was amazing. Some people thought he went too fast, 
                                    but that's why I liked him. He was very clear and concise, and his explanations were
                                    better than Erdmann's. 15-150 is overall an excellent course, and I would highly recommend it to anyone 
                                    interested in computer science. Functions are values!

                                <h3>02-251: Great Ideas in Computational Biology ❤️</h3>
                                <h4>Professor(s): Phillip Compeau</h4>
                                <p>
                                    02-251 made me fall in love with Computational
                                    Biology, and is one of the main reasons I am working at Mohimani Lab right now. Essentially,
                                    the course is a survey of all the pivotal algorithms that gave birth to the field of
                                    Computational Biology. From genome sequencing, to systems biology, to even neural networks,
                                    02-251 covers it all. It is a theory heavy class as a lot of the algorithms
                                    discussed make use of advanced techniques such as dynamic programming and graph theory. 
                                    Be prepared to do a lot of proofs about graphs and trees, but also  
                                    get ready to implement a lot of algorithms from scratch. From the Needleman-Wunsch alignment
                                    algorithm to creating multi layer perceptrons, this course will teach you how to 
                                    implement the most infuential algorithms in Computational Biology. Phillip is an excellent 
                                    lecturer, and his passion for the subject is evident in his lectures. He is also very 
                                    approachable and is always willing to help. Although the official pre-reqs for this class are only
                                    15-112 and 21-127/21-128/15-151, I would recommend taking 15-122 either before or concurrently 
                                    since it will help you with the programming assignments. Whether you are a computer scientist, 
                                    biologist, chemist, or mathematician, 02-251 is a must take course.
